# QGIS Regions Queries
Filter `TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3` map by REGION or SUBREGION and then export layer as a `XLSX` to extract M49 codes. `=TEXTJOIN(",";TRUE;D2:D1000)` in Excel to join M49 codes together.

Below you find queries for the layer `EEZ_Land_v3_202030` that combines fields like `UN_TER1`, `MRGID_EEZ` and `UN_SOV1`, to recreate Geoscheme's regions and subregions.
